# leetcode
A repository for LeetCode problems.

## Description
This is a repository where I will be storing my solutions and explanations for LeetCode problems, while I am learning algorithms and data structures. The solutions will be in Python, JavaScript, and C#.

## Explanation
- Each problem is organized into a separate folder (e.g., `problem-name-1/`, `problem-name-2/`).
- Inside each problem folder, there are subfolders for the solutions in each programming language:
  - `python/`
  - `javascript/`
  - `csharp/`
- Each subfolder contains the solution file (`solution.*`) and test cases (`test_solution.*`) for the respective language.
- Every problem folder includes a `README.md` file explaining the problem, approach, and complexity analysis.
- GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing can be found in the `.github/workflows/` directory.
